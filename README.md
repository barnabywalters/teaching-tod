# teaching-tod

Hi Tod! Hereâ€™s the project. Download the zip, then navigate to the folder and run:

* `easy_install pip` to install pip, then
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Flask, the dependency for the project, then:
* `python libfile.py` to run the libfile tests, and
* `python run.py` to run the webserver.

Have fun!
